INFO:
This is the matlab code of the paper 
X. Fei, M. Gou, O. Camps and M. Sznaier: "Person Re-Identification using Kernel-based Metric Learning Methods". In ECCV 2014.

STRUCTURE:
-All the main script and function codes are located under root path;
-All parsed datesets are located under "dataset/";
-All additional libs and data parsing codes are located under "Assistant Code/".

HOW TO RUN THE DEMO:
- Data preparation 
    Parsing images to appropriate format by running "load_DATASET.m" in folder "Assistant Code";
    If you want to use your own data set, please refer any load function for the detail of data structure 
- To run the example, please start with "run_demo.m";
- To get the final average results and PUR value, please run "Script_demo_result.m"
- To use ensemble fashion, one needs to run all the algorithms with all different features first and then run "Script_demo_Ensemble_result.m"
- Most parameters are set in "Set_Exp_Parameter.m", please modify them based on particular experiment. 
- Right now, this version support seven different algorithms. Among them, LFDA, rPCCA and MFA are proposed by ourselves; oLFDA and PCCA are re-implemented based on others' work; KISSME and svmml are modified from authors' code. PLEASE cite the corresponding paper properly. 

THIRD PARTY CODE:
- KISSME    
- svmml    
    PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PART CODE COULD ONLY BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE.
- Local Binary Pattern (Assistant Code/LBP)

DATASET:
Parsed iLIDS dataset is included in this package for quick testing. Please refer the following paper for more details about this dataset.
